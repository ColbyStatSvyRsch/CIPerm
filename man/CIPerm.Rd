\title{CIPerm: Computationally-Efficient Confidence Intervals for Mean Shift from Permutation Methods}
\description{
Implements computationally-efficient construction of
confidence intervals from permutation tests or randomization tests
for simple differences in means.
The method is based on Minh D. Nguyen's 2009 MS thesis paper,
"Nonparametric Inference using Randomization and Permutation
Reference Distribution and their Monte-Carlo Approximation,"
<\url{https://archives.pdx.edu/ds/psu/37406}>.
See the \code{nguyen} vignette for a brief summary of the method.
First use \code{\link{dset}} to tabulate summary statistics for each permutation.
Then pass the results into \code{\link{cint}} to compute a confidence interval,
or into \code{\link{pval}} to calculate p-values.
}
\details{
Our R function arguments and outputs are structured differently
than the similarly-named R functions in Nguyen (2009),
but the results are equivalent. In the \code{nguyen} vignette
we use our functions to replicate Nguyen's results.

Following Ernst (2004) and Nguyen (2009), we use "permutation methods"
to include both randomization tests and permutation tests.
In the simple settings in this R package,
the randomization and permutation test mechanics are identical,
but their interpretations may differ.

We say "randomization test" under the model where
the units are not necessarily a random sample, but the treatment assignment
was random. The null hypothesis is that the treatment has no effect.
In this case we can make causal inferences about the
treatment effect (difference between groups) for this set of individuals,
but cannot necessarily generalize to other populations.

By contrast, we say "permutation test" under the model where
the units were randomly sampled from two distinct subpopulations.
The null hypothesis is that the two groups have identical CDFs.
In this case we can make inferences about differences between subpopulations,
but there's not necessarily any "treatment" to speak of
and causal inferences may not be relevant.
